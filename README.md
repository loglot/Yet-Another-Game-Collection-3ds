# Yet Another Flappy Game 3ds Edition

that's right, i'm getting into 3ds homebrew

## running the game
1. get an emulator or a real 3ds with cfw

    1.1. for an emulator, i would recommend [azahar](https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar) as it is the newest fork combining progress from 2 of the largest forks

2. download the game

    you can download the game from 2 places

        indev: https://github.com/loglot/3ds-game/raw/refs/heads/main/3ds-game.3dsx

        stable: [no stable release]

    or, if you don't trust precompiled binaries, you can build it yourself!

        2.1. get [devkitpro](https://devkitpro.org/)

        2.2. download the source code localy

        2.3. run build in the main folder

3. open the game

    3.1. on a 3ds, you should put the .3dsx file onto the sd card, and open it with homebrew launcher

    3.2. on an emulator, you can just open the file like any other game
