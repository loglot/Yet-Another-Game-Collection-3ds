# Yet Another Game Collection 3ds

that's right, i'm getting into 3ds homebrew

## running the game
1. get an emulator or a real 3ds with cfw

    1.1. for an emulator, i would recommend [azahar](https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar) as it is the newest fork combining progress from 2 of the largest forks

2. download the game

    you can download the game from 1 place

        stable: [no stable release]

    or, if you don't trust precompiled binaries, you can build it yourself!

        2.1. get [devkitpro](https://devkitpro.org/)

        2.2. download the source code localy

        2.3. run `make` in the main folder

        2.4. [optional] run ./build.bat to get a cia file

            Note: build.bat runs 2 files, cxitool.exe, and makerom.exe, if you want, you can get these files from online, and replace the included files in 3dsx-to-cia, though, that is not required

3. open the game

    3.1. on a 3ds, you should put the .3dsx file onto the sd card, and open it with homebrew launcher

    3.2. on an emulator, you can just open the file like any other game

## planned features
i plan to make multiple of my games in this, not just 1,

there is a .cia version planned, i just have to learn how to do that, and that will be in the first stable release
